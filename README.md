## About Calcifer

Calcifer is a private [Discord](discordapp.com) bot written in C# [7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) using the [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) lib.

This bot is not really intended for use outside of the couple of servers I made it for. This is a tool for me to learn about the language and the lib.  The code is probably (read: is) sub par and should only be used as a very basic and shit example.
